#Orbit Racers
A game based on Newtonian orbital mechanics. Each level is a puzzle, and
you have to beat them in order to advance. The game gets really hard
real quick, but it does instill in you a sense of orbital mechanics, and
it's very possible to beat it. My best time is just over 6 minutes.
Requires `pygame`.

Made for my senior year multivariable calculus class "end of the year"
assignment, which was to "make a game involving multivariable calculus".
(The position of the ship can be described as *x* and *y*. That's two
variables right there!) Art and beta testing credit goes to my other
group members, and ultimately to the whole class.

## Controls:

- **left/right:** Rotate your ship counterclockwise and clockwise,
  respectively. The rotation is Newtonian, i.e. tapping the left key
adds counterclockwise angular velocity, so to stop spinning you need to
tap the right key.
- **space:** Fire the thrusters! Again, the game is Newtonian, so you
  won't magically slow down unless you fire the thrusters in the
opposite direction. (But do you want to slow down?)
- **tab:** Go into "trace mode", where your path is shown as a red line.
  I recommend it especially on Level 8. Just enable trace mode and sit
back and enjoy the trace. It's also helpful on Levels 4 and 6.

## Instructions:

Get to the green circle. Avoid the "stars" (white circles) and the edges
of the screen.
