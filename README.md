A game based on Newtonian orbital mechanics. Each level is a puzzle, and
you have to beat them in order to advance. The game gets really hard
real quick, but it does instill in you a sense of orbital mechanics, and
it's very possible to beat it. My best time is just over 6 minutes.

Made for my senior year multivariable calculus class "end of the year"
assignment, which was to "make a game involving multivariable calculus".
(The position of the ship can be described as *x* and *y*. That's two
variables right there!) Art and beta testing credit goes to my other
group members, and ultimately to the whole class.
